# dynamicPagePHP
I made a really simple dynamic web page with an Apache server, MySQL database management, and PHP.
This is a MAMP app.

Why I made it? Well, there is a course on Coursera.org called: "building database applications in php", 
it's from the University of Michigan. I "audit" the course and made this db app as a practice.
But now I move on in order to make a better project, will be a Chat Server web page.
